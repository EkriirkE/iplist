# This is an example allow list which must be in p2p format (optionally
# compressed with gzip). It's recommended to keep the number of  entries 
# small (e.g. 100).
#
# <Name> : <Start IP> - <End IP>
# Bluetack Mirror :	130.149.17.156	- 130.149.17.156
#
# Warning: don't use this list for custom entries because the package 
# manager might remove/override the changes made to this file.
# Instead create a separate list and add it to ALLOW_LIST 
# in /etc/ipblock.conf .
